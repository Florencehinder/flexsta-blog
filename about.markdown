Hi I'm Flo, from New Zealand but based in the UK. I enjoy exploring different parts of the world and I designed and built the FLEXSTA portable monitor stand. I built the first version of the FLEXSTA since I was working remotely and traveling a lot and needed a second screen to get my work done. I bought a portable monitor but I’d always be spending time trying to figure out how to position it in the correct spot and it was never quite right. After lots of research and plenty of help from reddit. Then after months of trialing out different iterations of the design and construction I came up with this pretty nifty design that I’m pretty excited about.

It’s super compact, sturdy and holds the monitor securely. If I’m working from a co-working space or cafe for the day I can just pop it in my bag with my laptop. It’s the simplest yet most effective setup I could dream up. Whenever I work with it, people ask me where they can get one! And that’s when I started selling the product - my first sale was to a friend I was co-working with!

You can place your screen above your laptop and you’ve got an ergonomic setup with a bunch of screen real estate. 

I really wanted a design that was high quality, looked really nice, easy to pack up and pack down and held the monitor securely. I spent a bunch of time sourcing the highest quality parts to bring you the Flex 1.0

I’m really excited to share with you the Flex 1.0, it really changed how I work and has given me the freedom to work from wherever I need to, I hope it can do the same for you!
